*A game library extension for* ***[EmulatorJS]***

<br>

This add - on reads the contents of your **ROM**s <br>
folder and uses it to display a games library. Roms <br>
with common endings, like .iso, .bin or .zip, you <br>
must also include the applicable extension before it. <br>
A list is included in this readme with the additional<br>
extensions, and will be updated as I go. <br>

**Example:** Crash Bandicoot.psx.zip

To use systems that require a bios, like psx, <br>
add the bios under the **BIOS** folder and name <br>
it the according system .bin <br>

**Example:** psx.bin 

<br>

## Installation

This is a drag and drop extension, with the <br>
exception that it requires something to host <br>
PHP files like XAMPP. Put your roms in the <br>
/roms/ folder and bios in the /bios/ folder, <br>
following the naming scheme shown here.


### Extensions
The following extensions are used in <br>
addition to common file extensions <br>

PlayStation - .psx.*
